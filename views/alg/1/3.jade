    h3 Greetings
    div
        p So far, you are very successful. So proud of you. However some of you might be too shy to commit your code. Come on, it's OK.
        p Don't be shy. See? I am using English even my English is so bad.
        p No matter how high is your codes' time complexity, what kind of data structure you are using, how much space you are wasting, you should just commit your code. Even it's not finished, we can discuss it, we will try to understand your design.
        p.text-danger
            b You can't be afraid to fail. It's the only way you succeed - you're not gonna succeed all the time, and I know that!
    h3 Introduction
    div
        p Here is your 3rd mission. Due date is [5/26/2014].
        p This is a relatively new problem from one of my friends' phone interview with facebook.(last Thursday)
        p Let's cross our fingers, pray for him, maybe we can get reference from him next year.

    h3 Mission 3 Detail [Pairs of Subtraction]
    p Given a unsorted array of distinct integers, find each pair whose subtraction result equals to target value.

    p For example,
    blockquote Given [5, 7, 8, 10, 12] and target value 2,
        br
        |return [5, 7], [8, 10], [10, 12].
    p Your algorithm's runtime complexity could be in the order of O(n) with extra space. Or better.
    p But you should commit your code anyway, even it's in the order of O(n*n*n).
